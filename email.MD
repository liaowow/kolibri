*Hi Kolibri team,

I work at a youth empowerment organization for out of school children in Ghana. We have programs at local community centers where children and youth come in periodically for vocational and life skills classes or to learn independently from the resources we have available.

Yesterday, I downloaded Kolibri at one of the centers. I spent several hours creating a class for some of our children and making user accounts for them. Then I went to import 65 GB of content and I started having problems. I clicked on the resources I wanted, and then clicked “Import” and it got stuck on the screen telling me it was preparing the content. It just stayed like that for a long time and didn’t change.

HELP!!!
