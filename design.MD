#### Briefly describe your approach to clarify needs and requirements from a designer before beginning to translate mockups into code.
Typography, color and layout styling guide --> Cross-browser compatibility constraints --> UI state management


#### What information do you need before you start tackling this particular feature?
Is it desktop only? Should we consider a responsive layout?
How would we handle duplicated study group names?
What happens after the user clicks "Confirm"?
(minor) What is the ordering rule for each column? For instance, in the Day Preference column, should we start on Sunday or Monday?

#### What do the specs tell you about the design and what other specs may help?
It gives me a holistic page layout and components needed. I think a visual styling guide and more detailed UI specs would be helpful.
